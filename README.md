# Bidirectional-DC-DC-Converter
this is a simple Bidirectional buck-boost converter simulation with regenerative braking for electric drives
This converter features a parallel capacitor and a modified auxiliary commutation circuit aimed at improving the commutation process of thyristors, ensuring more reliable operation.

Simulated model of a bidirectional buck-boost DC-DC converter
![At t = 0.75 seconds, the braking operation begins (with IGBT). The simulation records the armature current, electromagnetic torque, and rotor speed of the motor.](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51e8b0d5-0042-43c9-b81e-7e42998729e9)
